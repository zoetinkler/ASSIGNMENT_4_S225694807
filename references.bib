	abstract = {ABSTRACT Cysteine donates sulfur to macromolecules and occurs naturally in many proteins. Because low concentrations of cysteine are cytotoxic, its intracellular concentration is stringently controlled. In bacteria, cysteine biosynthesis is regulated by feedback inhibition of the activities of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) and is also regulated at the transcriptional level by inducing the cysteine regulon using the master regulator CysB. Here, we describe two novel cysteine-inducible systems that regulate the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis , a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing substances useful for biotechnological, medical, and industrial purposes. One locus, designated ccdA (formerly PAJ\_0331), encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) that degrades cysteine, and its expression is controlled by the transcriptional regulator encoded by ccdR (formerly PAJ\_0332 or ybaO ), located just upstream of ccdA . The other locus, designated cefA (formerly PAJ\_3026), encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine efflux pump that is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cefR (formerly PAJ\_3027), located just upstream of cefA . To our knowledge, this is the first example where the expression of CD and an efflux pump is regulated in response to cysteine and is directly involved in imparting resistance to excess levels of cysteine. We propose that ccdA and cefA function as safety valves that maintain homeostasis when the intra- or extracellular cysteine concentration fluctuates. Our findings contribute important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine and related biomaterials by P. ananatis . IMPORTANCE Because of its toxicity, the bacterial intracellular cysteine level is stringently regulated at biosynthesis. This work describes the identification and characterization of two novel cysteine-inducible systems that regulate, through degradation and efflux, the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis , a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing substances useful for industrial purposes. We propose that this novel mechanism for sensing and regulating cysteine levels is a safety valve enabling adaptation to sudden changes in intra- or extracellular cysteine levels in bacteria. Our findings provide important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine and related biomaterials by P. ananatis and also a deep understanding of sulfur/cysteine metabolism and regulation in this plant pathogen and related bacteria.},

	abstract = {Abstract In each genome, synonymous codons are used with different frequencies; this general phenomenon is known as codon usage bias. It has been previously recognised that codon usage bias could affect the cellular fitness and might be associated with the ecology of microbial organisms. In this exploratory study, we investigated the relationship between codon usage bias, lifestyles (thermophiles vs. mesophiles; pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic; halophilic vs. non-halophilic; aerobic vs. anaerobic and facultative) and habitats (aquatic, terrestrial, host-associated, specialised, multiple) of 615 microbial organisms (544 bacteria and 71 archaea). Principal component analysis revealed that species with given phenotypic traits and living in similar environmental conditions have similar codon preferences, as represented by the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) index, and similar spectra of tRNA availability, as gauged by the tRNA gene copy number (tGCN). Moreover, by measuring the average tRNA adaptation index (tAI) for each genome, an index that can be associated with translational efficiency, we observed that organisms able to live in multiple habitats, including facultative organisms, mesophiles and pathogenic bacteria, are characterised by a reduced translational efficiency, consistently with their need to adapt to different environments. Our results show that synonymous codon choices might be under strong translational selection, which modulates the choice of the codons to differently match tRNA availability, depending on the organism’s lifestyle needs. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study that examines the role of codon bias and translational efficiency in the adaptation of microbial organisms to the environment in which they live.},

	abstract = {Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is one of the most impactful regulators in E. coli and other bacteria. Lrp senses nutrient conditions and responds by controlling strategies for virulence, cellular motility, and nutrient acquisition. , ABSTRACT Feast-famine response proteins are a widely conserved class of global regulators in prokaryotes, the most highly studied of which is the Escherichia coli leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). Lrp senses the environmental nutrition status and subsequently regulates up to one-third of the genes in E. coli , either directly or indirectly. Lrp exists predominantly as octamers and hexadecamers (16mers), where leucine is believed to shift the equilibrium toward the octameric state. In this study, we analyzed the effects of three oligomerization state mutants of Lrp in terms of their ability to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression in response to exogenous leucine. We find that oligomerization beyond dimers is required for Lrp’s regulatory activity and that, contrary to previous speculation, exogenous leucine modulates Lrp activity at its target promoters exclusively by inhibiting Lrp binding to DNA. We also show evidence that Lrp binding bridges DNA over length scales of multiple kilobases, revealing a new range of mechanisms for Lrp-mediated transcriptional regulation. IMPORTANCE Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is one of the most impactful regulators in E. coli and other bacteria. Lrp senses nutrient conditions and responds by controlling strategies for virulence, cellular motility, and nutrient acquisition. Despite its importance and being evolutionarily highly conserved across bacteria and archaea, several mysteries remain regarding Lrp, including how it actually responds to leucine to change its regulation of targets. Previous studies have led to the hypothesis that Lrp switches between two states, an octamer (8 Lrp molecules together) and a hexadecamer (16 Lrp molecules together), upon exposure to leucine; these are referred to as different oligomerization states. Here, we show that contrary to previous expectations, it is Lrp’s propensity to bind DNA, rather than its oligomerization state, that is directly affected by leucine in the cell’s environment. Our new understanding of Lrp activity will aid in identifying and disrupting pathways used by bacteria to cause disease.},
